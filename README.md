## üîß How it works?
### 1. Asks for a json, via API

  Example link: https://games.roblox.com/v1/games/10449761463/servers/Public?sortOrder=Asc&limit=50

  Instead of 10449761463 you can enter your own game id. Look to the list.json

  
### 2. Receives Json

```json
[{"id":"f53e5181-3264-4536-b564-727de65a04e5","maxPlayers":15,"playing":1,"playerTokens":["9C39B894E6AF667C5E7D723047EA0AF9"],"players":[],"fps":59.925491,"ping":94},{"id":"4de2fc9e-bdc9-426f-9da4-c751b0f1329e","maxPlayers":15,"playing":1,"playerTokens":["EE2DD158A8EC4554546E337BFB293E26"],"players":[],"fps":59.992165,"ping":237},{"id":"46904c41-3640-4458-ab57-563c5391d939","maxPlayers":15,"playing":1,"playerTokens":["4ECFDCD21912FB999CF74D7C566E55A5"],"players":[],"fps":59.866371,"ping":242},{"id":"111220eb-9c3f-4545-b4ed-892aed3f8ae1","maxPlayers":15,"playing":1,"playerTokens":["4ED8B6BF2DC379020A07387E8AAD5907"],"players":[],"fps":59.990593,"ping":250},{"id":"c219b748-f8b5-4e55-9dc3-a28a1a5caab3","maxPlayers":15,"playing":1,"playerTokens":["E9A7D82DA89678B8C649BBF417D874B0"],"players":[],"fps":59.940697,"ping":241}
```

### 3. Script sorts recived json and shows everything in a table

| **Server 1** | **Server 2** | **Server 3** |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| ping        | ping        | ping        |
